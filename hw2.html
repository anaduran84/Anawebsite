<p>For this picture that I edited I first put the brightness to -4 then i put the contrast to 33. I then set the vibrance to -18 then the saturation to -8. I then played around with the curves but I'm not sure what i set it to. All in all the edits i made, gave my picture more color and made it more warm.   /p>
