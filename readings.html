<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In “On Photography” by Susan Sontag, the chapter “Plato’s Cave” uses Plato’s metaphor to explain that shapes are not only how we see the world but how we understand it. While I was reading this chapter, I really found interesting that Sontag explains how photographs are both knowledge and illusion. It compares to the prisoners in, “Plato’s Cave” mistaking the shadows on the wall for what is real. A lot of people can mistake photographs for the truth. These two things have a lot in common because it shows how photography has a big impact on our perception.  </p>
<p>Sontag sees photography as powerful. She thinks this because, it creates a sense of understanding without true engagement. Photographs feel restrictive because it just captures what’s going on in that moment instead of capturing the full story. What happened before and after. This chapter questions the trust in photography. Photographs can be cropped and framed so maybe the full story isn’t really captured. You’re only seeing what is captured but no the full story. It can give off the appearance of reality when that might not be the case. The connection that this chapter has to their cave metaphor is, we are drawn to pictures not because that’s the reality but because it's easier to understand than reality. This is why images makes us feel something and how we are so comfortable creating our own story instead of knowing the real one behind the image. .</p>
<p>Another connection I made was, that Sontag thinks that photography creates a distance between the viewer and the subject, how photography can numb us. The more pictures we see of violence and war the less impact each one has. This is another connection to the cave prisoners that see’s shadows so much hat it becomes normal to them. This goes to the argument that the more we see and consume, the less we feel, making us numb. The camera takes pictures that turn reality into something that we can easily see. This makes violence and and war into something we can visually experience instead of something tragic and sad.   </p>
<p>Sontag also says how photography can create identity. To take a picture of something, claim it and to turn it into an object for people to see. This creates power, the photographer can control what to take a picture of and that will be what the viewer sees. There is a connection between capturing something and documenting it instead of living it. Sontag shows that photography isn’t neutral, it shows the human need to perceive the worlds virtually.   </p>
<p>In conclusion, the chapter, “Plato’s Cave” shows the connection between photography and uncertainty. Photographs can create the illusion of reality by capturing what we want the viewer to see. Sontag also shows how photos don’t define the real world. It shows a piece of reality without the full story. It shows that today’s day and age just like the prisoners from Plato’s cave prefer easy to digest images over the difficult ones that actually make us feel something. </p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>After reading “With ‘Ai Slop’ Distorting Our Reality, The World Is Sleepwalking Into Disaster” by Nesrine Malik, it showed how the world is running on AI and how we use it in our everyday lives. It talks about how AI is manipulative, and what she calls “AI Slop”. Malik’s argument is that AI is destroying the way we live and the way we think as a society. It’s reshaping our reality and building distrust amongst ourselves. You can see this in social media, the news and digital life in general. </p>
<p>Malik describes, “two parallel image channels” the first one is, real events, footage and legitimate journalism. The second one is, AI-generated, chat apps and private messaging. The second one is growing faster. I connect this with my everyday life because even my social media is filled with AI- generated images that are sometimes hard to tell if it’s real or not. Some of these examples can go from AI-generated videos of bunnies jumping on trampolines to music created from an AI-generated artist. This can build distrust within viewers because a bazaar video can have you questioning wether it’s AI-generated or not. Malik mentions this throughout the article stating how fake content warps the sense of what is “real” and what is staged. This is true in this day and age because AI-generated content is becoming harder and harder to tell apart from real content.  </p>
<p>Malik says how content production has changed overtime and how engagement is overpowering authenticity. This thrives because people like to see wide opening content and things that give them dopamine instead of real issues or real videos. This makes real content blend in with fake content. For me personally it was real life issues blended with AI-generated content making it hard to tell what is going on in the world. The article emphasizes that seeing is no longer believing and that you have to question everything you see.  </p>
<p>Something I found interesting was how the right-wing people and “Ai political meme fare”.  This includes fully made-up videos, AI-generated political photos, and “Made-up scenarios” which all include the use of AI to make their political views look better. This also shows how the far-right people use AI to are their points. This misinforms people into thinking something that’s not true. This content is often created by the younger generation and it spreads ideological imagination. I connected that that then AI- generated memes I see on my social media push false narratives and create misinformation.  </p>
<p>Malik says that “slop” can lead to desensitization which is already happening with the younger generation Gen Alpha I can’t imagine what’s going to happen with Gen Beta. This makes me double check any video or picture I come across on the internet brvause I always question wether it’s AI-generated or not. </p>

<p>In conclusion, Malik brought up powerful points in the article on how AI-generated content has coming up and has been producing “AI slop”. Three things stuck with me while reading this article which was, questioning what is real and fake, using AI for political gain, and the AI content that can’t be misinforming people. </p>

<p>In the Graphic Novel, “Motherhood In Crisis” by by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah, Al Jazeera the story of Memunatu, “The Distant Patient” shows the tough journey she had to go through in childbirth. In Sierra Leone where mother mortality is very high and health care is not the best. Memunatu’s story is very powerful because it captures the the present time. The readers can see and feel Menmunatu’s story since its not a photo where you just see the picture and not interact with it. You can feel her expressions and fears in the graphics. The illustrations were made in a way where it bring us in as viewers and helps us relate to to the emotional and hard side of childbirth. Al Jazeera allows the readers to connect with the story almost cinematically.  <p>
<p>The thing that I noticed visually was that the photos from this story were different from every story in the series. These kind of photos show what is really happening in their lives, their reality and their struggles. This is where I interpreted the images for what I thought it was trying to show me and that is not something a camera can usually capture. A photo might show Memunatu it the clinic but the illustration shows her facial expression to the point where you can see exactly what she’s feeling in ther moment. This can have the viewer feeling empathy for the person in the illustration. The illustration has texts and even a video which engages the audience by making its multi-sensory.  <p>
<p>The upside of including illustrations with the text and other forms of media is that it can show emotion and continuity. For example, thre text can explain how fragile the healthcare system is and how the women have to travel long distances. On the other hand the illuastrations show the actual emotions and concerns Memanatu was feeling while having to walk in the heat to reach the care she needed.  <p>
<p>In conclusion Sierra Leone’s maternal health was not good enough it affected Memanatu and so many women like her. We as viewers are seeing what is going on in her world while is experiencing it.  <p>
