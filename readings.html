<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In “On Photography” by Susan Sontag, the chapter “Plato’s Cave” uses Plato’s metaphor to explain that shapes are not only how we see the world but how we understand it. While I was reading this chapter, I really found interesting that Sontag explains how photographs are both knowledge and illusion. It compares to the prisoners in, “Plato’s Cave” mistaking the shadows on the wall for what is real. A lot of people can mistake photographs for the truth. These two things have a lot in common because it shows how photography has a big impact on our perception.  </p>
<p>Sontag sees photography as powerful. She thinks this because, it creates a sense of understanding without true engagement. Photographs feel restrictive because it just captures what’s going on in that moment instead of capturing the full story. What happened before and after. This chapter questions the trust in photography. Photographs can be cropped and framed so maybe the full story isn’t really captured. You’re only seeing what is captured but no the full story. It can give off the appearance of reality when that might not be the case. The connection that this chapter has to their cave metaphor is, we are drawn to pictures not because that’s the reality but because it's easier to understand than reality. This is why images makes us feel something and how we are so comfortable creating our own story instead of knowing the real one behind the image. .</p>
<p>Another connection I made was, that Sontag thinks that photography creates a distance between the viewer and the subject, how photography can numb us. The more pictures we see of violence and war the less impact each one has. This is another connection to the cave prisoners that see’s shadows so much hat it becomes normal to them. This goes to the argument that the more we see and consume, the less we feel, making us numb. The camera takes pictures that turn reality into something that we can easily see. This makes violence and and war into something we can visually experience instead of something tragic and sad.   </p>
<p>Sontag also says how photography can create identity. To take a picture of something, claim it and to turn it into an object for people to see. This creates power, the photographer can control what to take a picture of and that will be what the viewer sees. There is a connection between capturing something and documenting it instead of living it. Sontag shows that photography isn’t neutral, it shows the human need to perceive the worlds virtually.   </p>
<p>In conclusion, the chapter, “Plato’s Cave” shows the connection between photography and uncertainty. Photographs can create the illusion of reality by capturing what we want the viewer to see. Sontag also shows how photos don’t define the real world. It shows a piece of reality without the full story. It shows that today’s day and age just like the prisoners from Plato’s cave prefer easy to digest images over the difficult ones that actually make us feel something. </p>
