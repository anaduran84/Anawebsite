<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In “On Photography” by Susan Sontag, the chapter “Plato’s Cave” uses Plato’s metaphor to explain that shapes are not only how we see the world but how we understand it. While I was reading this chapter, I really found interesting that Sontag explains how photographs are both knowledge and illusion. It compares to the prisoners in, “Plato’s Cave” mistaking the shadows on the wall for what is real. A lot of people can mistake photographs for the truth. These two things have a lot in common because it shows how photography has a big impact on our perception.  </p>
<p>Sontag sees photography as powerful. She thinks this because, it creates a sense of understanding without true engagement. Photographs feel restrictive because it just captures what’s going on in that moment instead of capturing the full story. What happened before and after. This chapter questions the trust in photography. Photographs can be cropped and framed so maybe the full story isn’t really captured. You’re only seeing what is captured but no the full story. It can give off the appearance of reality when that might not be the case. The connection that this chapter has to their cave metaphor is, we are drawn to pictures not because that’s the reality but because it's easier to understand than reality. This is why images makes us feel something and how we are so comfortable creating our own story instead of knowing the real one behind the image. .</p>
