<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In “On Photography” by Susan Sontag, the chapter “Plato’s Cave” uses Plato’s metaphor to explain that shapes are not only how we see the world but how we understand it. While I was reading this chapter, I really found interesting that Sontag explains how photographs are both knowledge and illusion. It compares to the prisoners in, “Plato’s Cave” mistaking the shadows on the wall for what is real. A lot of people can mistake photographs for the truth. These two things have a lot in common because it shows how photography has a big impact on our perception.  </p>
