<h1>Homework 6: Vector Emotive Eye</h1>

</p>	For this homework I chose to work with he colors red and green because they are the colors that are across from each other in the color wheel. For the eye itself I created two circles, crossed them together so they can make an oval shape in the middle. I only cut the middle out to make an eye shape. Then I filled it in with the color red. Then for the pupils I made two circles one for the inner pupil and one for the outer pupil. The outer one I filled it with green and the inner one I filled it with red, creating that contrast. The rims of both of them are black. For the eyebrow I made a rectangle, and I used the curve tool to make it look mad, confused, or concerned. Then I filled the eyebrow with green. For the eyelashes I just made rectangles and attached them to the eye. I did not fill the eyebrows.</body>p>
