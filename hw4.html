<h1>Homework 4: Photomontage</h1>
<img src="photomontage.jpg" widh="500px"> 
</p>For the first photomontage I chose a picture from upsplash. I chose this picture in specific because it shows a lot of juxtaposition, a TV in a grass field is very opposite to me. This picture is something that catches your eye so I wanted to work with that. What I did for this picture was add a marble colorful background to the Television screen. I wanted something colorful because I wanted it to be the first thing that grabbed the viewers attention. For the Soda can part I wanted to edit only some soda cans for two reasons. The first reason was to show the viewer exact what was on top of the Television. The second reason I put a water background was to show the viewer another part of juxtaposition, to have them thinking of how can water be in a soda can.</body>p>

</p>The second picture is also from upsplash, I chose this picture because I liked the vespa and the background. I wanted to edit this picture in a way that showed nature in the picture. I put the ocean background in the wall because I wanted the picture to look out of place. I put some grass coming out of the wall to make it look out of place as well. Like how can grass from land and ocean be coming out from the same place. I then put grass on the wheels and the seat to give it an earth tone because vespas are not good for the environment like cars.</p>
